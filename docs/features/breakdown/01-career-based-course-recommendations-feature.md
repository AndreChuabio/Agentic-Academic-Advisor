## Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: Recommendation generation under 2 seconds (including Azure OpenAI calls)
- **Throughput**: Support 1000+ concurrent recommendation requests
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with Azure Load Balancer
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with Azure health checks
- **Data Consistency**: Eventually consistent with career data updates
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 80%+ for frequently accessed career mappings
- **Azure OpenAI Rate Limits**: Respect token limits and implement request queuing

## Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: JWT token validation for all endpoints
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (student, advisor, admin)
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization and validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse with request throttling
- **Data Privacy**: PII encryption at rest and in transit with Azure Key Vault
- **Audit Logging**: Track all career goal modifications
- **Azure OpenAI Security**: Secure API key management and request logging

## Cost Optimization with Azure
- **Azure Free Tier**: Utilize free database and app service tiers for development
- **Azure OpenAI**: Monitor token usage and implement intelligent caching
- **Azure Redis**: Use basic tier for development, scale as needed
- **Azure App Service**: Start with free tier, upgrade based on usage
- **Azure Application Insights**: Free tier includes 1GB/month data ingestion
- **Total Estimated Cost**: $0-50/month for development (leveraging free tiers)
