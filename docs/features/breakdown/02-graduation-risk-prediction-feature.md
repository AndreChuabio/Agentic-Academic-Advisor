4. **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific suggestions provided for risk mitigation
5. **Historical Tracking**: Risk trend analysis over multiple semesters

## Risk Calculation Algorithm
```java
public RiskScore calculateRisk(StudentProgress progress) {
    double paceRisk = calculatePaceRisk(progress);      // 40% weight
    double gpaRisk = calculateGPATrend(progress);       // 30% weight
    double prerequisiteRisk = calculatePrereqGaps(progress); // 30% weight
    
    double totalRisk = (paceRisk * 0.4) + (gpaRisk * 0.3) + (prerequisiteRisk * 0.3);
    return new RiskScore(totalRisk, determineRiskLevel(totalRisk));
}
```

## Success Response (200 OK)
Return risk assessment including:
- Overall risk score (0-100)
- Risk level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Individual risk factor breakdowns
- Actionable recommendations
- Historical trend data
- Next assessment date

## Error Handling
- Return 404 Not Found if student record doesn't exist
- Return 400 Bad Request for invalid assessment parameters
- Return 503 Service Unavailable if external data sources fail
- Return 500 Internal Server Error for calculation failures

## Risk Level Definitions
- **GREEN (Low Risk 0-30%)**: On track for timely graduation
- **YELLOW (Medium Risk 31-60%)**: Minor adjustments needed
- **RED (High Risk 61-100%)**: Immediate intervention required

```json
{
  "highRiskActions": [
    "You're 6 credits behind pace. Consider summer coursework.",
    "Schedule meeting with academic advisor immediately.",
    "Enroll in MATH 201 to unlock blocked required courses."
  ],
  "mediumRiskActions": [
    "Consider increasing to 15 credits next semester.",
    "Your GPA trend suggests tutoring may be beneficial."
  ]
}
```

## Database Triggers
