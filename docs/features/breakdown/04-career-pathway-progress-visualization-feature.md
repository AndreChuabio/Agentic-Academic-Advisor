    double totalMaxWeight = 0.0;
    
    for (SkillRequirement req : requirements) {
        double skillLevel = getStudentSkillLevel(student, req.getSkill());
        double importance = req.getImportanceWeight();
        totalWeightedScore += (skillLevel * importance);
        totalMaxWeight += (MAX_SKILL_LEVEL * importance);
    }
    
    double readinessPercentage = (totalWeightedScore / totalMaxWeight) * 100;
