# User Story: 03 - Interactive Prerequisite Mapping and Course Sequencing

**As a** student planning my academic pathway,
**I want** to visualize course prerequisites and optimal course sequences,
**so that** I can efficiently progress toward my degree without prerequisite conflicts or scheduling delays.

## Acceptance Criteria

* System displays interactive prerequisite visualization with courses as nodes and prerequisites as directional edges
* Student can see complete prerequisite chains for any course in their program
* System identifies prerequisite gaps preventing enrollment in desired courses
* Prerequisite visualizer integrates with degree planning and course recommendation tools
* System suggests optimal course sequences based on prerequisite requirements and career goals
* Student can explore alternative pathways when preferred courses are unavailable
* Visual representation shows prerequisite depth and complexity for degree planning
* System handles complex scenarios: double majors, minors, interdisciplinary programs
* Real-time updates when course catalogs or prerequisites change

## Graph Database Implementation

**Data Structure:**
- Courses as nodes with metadata (credits, difficulty, availability)
- Prerequisites as directed edges with relationship types
- Corequisites as bidirectional edges
- Prerequisite alternatives as conditional branches

**Pathfinding Algorithms:**
- Shortest path to degree completion
- Alternative route discovery when courses unavailable
- Optimal sequencing considering course offering schedules
- Conflict detection for prerequisite violations

## Visual Interface Features

**Interactive Graph View:**
- Drag-and-drop course planning interface
- Color-coded nodes: completed (green), available (blue), blocked (red), in-progress (yellow)
- Zoom and pan functionality for complex degree programs
- Filter by semester, department, or credit hours

**Course Sequence Timeline:**
- Semester-by-semester degree plan visualization
- Prerequisite dependency highlighting
- Course availability calendar integration
- Credit hour distribution across semesters

## Technical Architecture

* Graph database structure (Neo4j or similar) for prerequisite relationships
* Pathfinding algorithms for optimal course sequencing
* Integration with university course catalog systems
* Real-time sync with student enrollment data
* Microservices architecture for scalability

## Integration Requirements

* University Student Information Systems (Banner, PeopleSoft)
* Course catalog and scheduling systems
* Academic advisor tools and interfaces
* Student degree audit systems

## Edge Cases and Complex Scenarios

**Double Majors:**
- Prerequisite optimization across multiple degree requirements
- Shared course identification and credit application
- Timeline adjustment for increased credit requirements

**Interdisciplinary Programs:**
- Custom prerequisite chains for unique programs
- Flexible requirement mapping
- Alternative course approval workflows

**Transfer Students:**
- Credit evaluation and prerequisite satisfaction mapping
- Gap analysis for missing foundational courses
- Accelerated pathway recommendations

## Performance Requirements

* Sub-second response time for prerequisite queries
* Real-time updates when student data changes
* Scalability to handle 10,000+ concurrent users
* 99.9% uptime for critical academic planning periods

## Error Handling

* Graceful degradation when course data unavailable
* Clear messaging for prerequisite conflicts
* Alternative suggestions when optimal paths blocked
* Escalation to human advisors for complex cases

## Notes

* System designed as complement to existing infrastructure, not replacement
* Powerful pathfinding enables degree completion optimization
* Future integration with career pathway recommendations
* Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go course planning
