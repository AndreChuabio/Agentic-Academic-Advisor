# AI Academic Advisor - POC Implementation

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a **Proof of Concept (POC)** for an AI-powered Academic Advisor system that demonstrates how artificial intelligence can help students avoid late graduations and make better academic choices. The system provides early warning risk assessments, personalized course recommendations, prerequisite visualizations, and career progress tracking.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Graduation Risk Assessment ⚠️
- **Purpose**: Early warning system to prevent late graduations
- **Input**: Student ID
- **Output**: Risk level (Green/Yellow/Red) with actionable recommendations
- **Algorithm**: Analyzes credit progress, GPA trends, and semester pacing

### 2. Career-Based Course Recommendations 📚
- **Purpose**: Personalized course guidance based on career goals
- **Input**: Career selection + optional student ID
- **Output**: Prioritized course recommendations with explanations
- **Algorithm**: Matches courses to career requirements and filters completed courses

### 3. Prerequisite Visualization 🔗
- **Purpose**: Clear visualization of course dependencies
- **Input**: Course ID
- **Output**: Visual prerequisite chain showing course relationships
- **Algorithm**: Displays prerequisite trees for academic planning

### 4. Career Progress Tracking 📊
- **Purpose**: Track student readiness for target careers
- **Input**: Student ID + Career Goal
- **Output**: Progress percentage, completion status, and next steps
- **Algorithm**: Calculates completion based on required courses

## 🛠 Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **API**: Next.js API Routes (REST endpoints)
- **Data**: Mock data (hardcoded for POC)
