# AI Academic Advisor - POC Implementation

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a **Proof of Concept (POC)** for an AI-powered Academic Advisor system that demonstrates how artificial intelligence can help students avoid late graduations and make better academic choices. The system provides early warning risk assessments, personalized course recommendations, prerequisite visualizations, and career progress tracking.

**🆕 NEW: Admin Management Extension**
The POC now includes a comprehensive administrative interface for managing courses and graduate programs. See `ADMIN_EXTENSION_README.md` for detailed documentation of the new admin capabilities.
