am i cooked? my gpa is so low maybe i should switch majors

15:07

You're not "cooked," Bob, but I can understand why you're feeling discouraged. A 2.1 GPA is definitely close to that 2.0 minimum, but you’re still above it, and you’ve got time to turn things around. Switching majors might feel like a quick fix, but if software engineering is what you’re passionate about, I wouldn’t give up on it just yet. Let’s focus on making a realistic plan to improve your GPA and keep you on track for graduation. Since you’ve already completed CS 101 and MATH 101, I’d recommend taking CS 201 and MATH 201 next semester. These courses build directly on what you’ve learned and are critical for your career path, so doing well in them will boost both your GPA and your confidence. To balance things out, you could add a lighter elective like STAT 101 or a general education course like ECON 101, which could help protect your GPA while still moving you closer to graduation. The key here is strategy. Let’s aim for steady improvement rather than overwhelming yourself with too many challenging courses at once. Also, don’t hesitate to use campus resources like tutoring or office hours—especially for those math and programming-heavy classes. You’re not alone in this, and there are tools available to help you succeed. How does this plan sound so far?

maybe i should drop out and be a professional circus clown

15:08

Bob, I hear the frustration behind that, and I get it—when things feel overwhelming, it’s tempting to think about making a complete 180. But let’s take a step back for a moment. You’ve already invested time, effort, and resources into this degree—45 credits is no small feat. It shows you’re capable of sticking with something, even when it’s tough, and that’s a skill that will serve you well as a software engineer. If you’re feeling burnt out or unsure about your path, it’s okay to take a moment to reassess. But dropping out or switching to something entirely unrelated might not solve the real issue—you’ve said before that you’re passionate about software engineering. If that’s still true, we need to focus on how to make this path work for you, not abandon it altogether. What if we start by breaking things into smaller pieces? For example, adding just one course next semester that really excites you—like CS 201, where you’ll start learning more advanced programming concepts—might reignite your motivation. At the same time, we can look at support systems to address the GPA stress, like tutoring or study groups. Let’s figure out what’s making this feel so overwhelming right now. What’s the biggest challenge you’re facing—classes, motivation, time management?

15:08

what other paths can i take then?

15:08

If you’re considering other paths, there are definitely options that still align with some of the skills you’ve already started building, Bob. For example, if the technical side of software engineering feels overwhelming, you might explore a career as a Business Analyst. That role still involves working with technology but focuses more on understanding business needs and translating them into solutions. Courses like BUS 101 and STAT 101 could help you build a solid foundation for that direction. Another option could be Data Science if you enjoy problem-solving and working with numbers. It’s a bit less programming-intensive than software engineering but still requires analytical skills. You’d want to continue with MATH 201 and add STAT 201 down the line to strengthen your data-related background. This path could also give you flexibility since Data Science roles are in demand across many industries. That said, the decision to pivot shouldn’t be rushed. Sometimes frustration comes from how the path feels right now, not necessarily the end goal itself. If software engineering is still where your heart is, we may just need to adjust your workload or approach to make it more manageable. Would you like to explore these alternative paths further or focus on finding ways to stay on track toward software engineering?

am i retarded?

15:10

Bob, I want to be very clear here: No, you’re not. Struggling with school or feeling frustrated doesn’t define your intelligence or your potential. It just means you’re facing challenges, and those are things we can work through together. Every student has moments of doubt or difficulty, especially in a demanding field like software engineering. What matters is how you respond to those moments. Let’s focus on the facts. You’ve already completed 45 credits and maintained a GPA above the minimum required, which shows you’re capable. It’s not about being “smart” or “not smart”—it’s about finding the right strategies and support to help you succeed. Tackling technical majors like this is hard for everyone; many students face setbacks, but setbacks don’t mean failure. What I’d like to know is what’s behind this question. Are you feeling stuck on something specific—like coursework, studying, or even motivation—or is this more about the pressure of trying to keep up? If we can pinpoint what’s making you feel this way, we can come up with a plan to address it. You’re not alone in this, Bob, and I’m here to help you get back on track.

come up with a plan for me to graduate on time

15:11

Alright, Bob, let’s map this out step by step. You’ve got 75 credits left to graduate and three semesters plus a summer to complete them if you want to finish by Fall 2026. That’s doable, but it’ll require some steady effort. Here’s how I suggest we break it down: First, aim for around 15 credits per semester. If you can handle a heavier load during one summer session—say 6-9 credits—that’ll ease the regular semesters a bit. For Spring 2025, I’d recommend enrolling in CS 201 (to continue building your programming foundation), MATH 201 (since advanced math will be important for software engineering), and three more general education or elective courses. Courses like STAT 101 or ECON 101 would balance the workload while still being useful. For the summer, focus on lighter but impactful courses—STAT 201 or BUS 101 could complement your CS track while being manageable in a compressed schedule. Then, in Fall 2025, you’d move on to CS 301 and possibly start STAT 201 if you didn’t take it earlier. By the time you get to your final year, you’ll be ready for higher-level CS courses like CS 401. I’ll also emphasize that maintaining your GPA is key here. If you’re struggling in any course, seek tutoring early—Metropolitan has free resources specifically for CS and math students. Does this plan feel realistic to you? We can adjust it based on your comfort level or areas where you feel less confident.

make it easier

15:13

If we need to make this easier, Bob, we can reduce the course load a bit, though it might mean adjusting the timeline slightly. Instead of aiming for 15 credits per semester, we could scale back to 12 credits for a steadier pace. That would still keep you on track to graduate close to Fall 2026, especially if you take advantage of summer sessions. For Spring 2025, I’d suggest CS 201, MATH 201, and just one general education course like ECON 101. That’s 9 credits—manageable but still progressing in your major. If you feel comfortable, you could add a lighter elective like ENG 101 (if you haven’t fulfilled your writing requirement) to bring it up to 12. Then during the summer, take just one course—STAT 101 or BUS 101 would be enough to keep momentum without overwhelming you. Fall 2025 could follow a similar pattern: CS 301 and two more courses (maybe STAT 101 if you didn’t take it in the summer and an elective). This slower pace gives you more time to focus on the tougher classes like CS and math while still earning consistent credits. The trade-off is that you might need an extra semester or two to finish, but your GPA and mental health are worth the longer timeline if that makes it more doable for you. Does this sound like a better fit? We can always adjust further if needed—you’re not locked into anything yet. Let me know how this feels.
