What courses should I take next semester?

15:16

Since you’re aiming to become a teacher and eventually go to graduate school, let’s focus on keeping you on track with your education courses while also fulfilling general education requirements. Based on what you've completed so far, I’d recommend taking EDU 201, as it’s the next step in the education sequence and will give you more foundational knowledge about teaching. Additionally, you’ll want to enroll in STAT 101. Many teaching programs require a basic understanding of statistics, and it will also help strengthen your quantitative reasoning skills, which can be useful when analyzing student data in the future. Since you’ve already completed ENG 101, consider adding a course like ECON 101 or PHY 101 to meet general education science or social science requirements, depending on your interests. That schedule would give you a good balance of education-focused and general courses. It’s important to keep your GPA above 3.0, especially since you're considering grad school—so focus on courses you feel confident you can succeed in. How does this plan feel to you? Would you like to discuss workload or any other concerns?

i kinda wanna be a investment banker loser now, what should i do to pivot towards that?

15:17

That’s quite a shift, Emma, but it’s definitely not impossible to pivot toward investment banking if that’s where your interest is now. The first thing to consider is whether this change aligns with what excites you long-term. Investment banking is a demanding field that typically requires strong quantitative skills, a business foundation, and excellent networking abilities. To start moving in that direction, you’ll need to focus on building relevant skills and coursework. I’d recommend enrolling in BUS 101 next semester to begin exploring the fundamentals of business. Pair that with STAT 101 to strengthen your data analysis skills—both are essential for the finance world. If you feel ready for more math, adding MATH 201 would also be helpful since many finance roles rely heavily on calculus. It’s also worth thinking about internships or student organizations related to finance to start gaining experience and professional connections. Our Career Center could help you locate opportunities or workshops on networking in the business world. Let me also be upfront—investment banking can be very competitive, so a high GPA (closer to 3.5) will be crucial, as will possibly pursuing additional certifications or graduate studies down the line. Does this feel like a direction you're ready to commit to, or would you like to explore it further before making decisions?

tell me more about the skill set i would need to chase after this silly goal

If investment banking is the direction you want to pursue, you'll need to build a mix of technical, analytical, and interpersonal skills. Let’s break it down: First, technical skills are critical. You’ll need a strong foundation in financial modeling, corporate finance, and accounting principles. While we don’t have advanced finance courses here, taking BUS 101 and BUS 201 will help you start understanding business fundamentals. Pair that with STAT 101 and, eventually, STAT 201 to develop the data analysis skills you'll need for evaluating financial trends. Over time, you may also want to learn tools like Excel for financial modeling or even programming languages like Python if you're interested in quantitative finance. Analytical thinking is another key area. Investment banking requires you to evaluate companies’ financial health and market conditions under tight deadlines. Courses like MATH 201 (calculus) will sharpen your problem-solving abilities, which are highly transferable. Additionally, consider ECON 101 to understand market behavior—it’s foundational for making sense of economic trends that impact the finance world. Finally, soft skills like communication and networking are just as important. You’ll need to present complex financial data clearly and build relationships with clients or colleagues. Joining business-focused student organizations or practicing public speaking could help you strengthen these areas. Networking is particularly crucial in this field, as internships and job opportunities often come through connections. If this all still sounds exciting to you, let’s focus on a plan where you can gradually build these skills while keeping your GPA strong. Would you like help mapping out your next few semesters or exploring internship options?

15:20

yes please

Alright, Emma, let’s map this out step by step. You have 90 credits left to graduate, so we’ll need to balance building your skill set for investment banking with meeting your degree requirements. Here’s how I’d recommend structuring the next few semesters: For the upcoming semester, prioritize BUS 101 to start laying the groundwork in business fundamentals. Pair that with STAT 101, which will begin strengthening your quantitative and analytical skills. To round it out, consider ECON 101—this will fulfill a general education requirement while introducing you to economic concepts that are directly relevant in finance. This combination gives you a strong start without overloading your schedule. In the following semester, you could move on to BUS 201 for more advanced business concepts and STAT 201 to keep building your data analysis expertise. If you’re ready for it, MATH 201 (calculus) would be an excellent addition to sharpen your problem-solving skills. This progression ensures you’re steadily developing both technical and analytical capabilities. Alongside classes, I’d strongly encourage you to connect with the Career Center to start looking into internships or finance-related student organizations. Even something like shadowing a finance professional can give you insight into the field and help you build connections. We’ll also want to monitor your GPA closely—investment banking is competitive, so aiming for a 3.5 or higher will make you a stronger candidate. Does this plan feel manageable? If you’re ready, we can discuss how to register for these courses or look at summer options for additional experience.

whats my major again?

15:24

Your current major is Education, Emma, since your original goal was to become a teacher. That’s why you’ve already completed EDU 101 and some foundational courses like ENG 101 and MATH 101. If you’re serious about pivoting to investment banking, though, we’ll need to discuss whether it makes sense to change your major to something like Business or Economics, both of which align better with that career path. Switching majors isn’t something to decide on lightly, especially since you’ve already completed 30 credits. If you do decide to switch, some of your completed courses might still count toward your new degree requirements, especially general education courses like MATH 101 and ENG 101. However, specialized courses like EDU 101 may not transfer over, so we’ll need to carefully map out how this change would affect your timeline to graduation. How are you feeling about potentially changing your major? If you’re still unsure, you could stick with Education for now while taking a few business-related courses like BUS 101 or ECON 101 to explore the field further before making any big decisions.
