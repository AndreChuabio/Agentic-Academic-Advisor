### Step 3: Optimize Screenshots

#### Best Practices:
- **Resolution**: Take screenshots at 1440px width or higher
- **Browser**: Use Chrome or Safari for consistent rendering
- **Zoom**: Use 100% browser zoom for accurate representation
- **File Format**: Save as PNG for best quality
- **File Size**: Keep under 2MB each (compress if needed)

#### Screenshot Settings:
- Full page screenshots for dashboard views
- Focused screenshots for specific features
- Include some browser chrome for context (optional)
- Ensure text is readable and UI elements are clear

### Step 4: Naming Convention

Save files with these exact names in the `screenshots/` folder:
```
screenshots/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main-dashboard.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ risk-assessment.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ course-recommendations.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prerequisite-visualization.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ career-progress.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ admin-interface.png
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ graduate-programs.png
```

### Step 5: Verify in README

After adding screenshots, check that they display correctly:
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. View your repository README on GitHub
3. Ensure all images load properly
4. Check that images are appropriately sized

## üõ† Tools for Taking Screenshots

## üìù Alternative: Using GitHub for Image Hosting

If you prefer not to store images in your repository:

1. Create a new GitHub issue in your repository
2. Drag and drop your screenshots into the issue comment
3. GitHub will generate URLs like: `https://github.com/user/repo/assets/...`
4. Copy these URLs and replace the local paths in your README:

```markdown
![Main Dashboard](https://github.com/AchuabioPALO/AI-Academic-Advisor/assets/123456789/abc123def456.png)
```
